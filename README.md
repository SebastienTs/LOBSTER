Since LOBSTER includes many sample images, they should be downloaded from an external source: create an empty folder named Images in the downloaded/cloned LOBSTER repository and unzip the content of this [archive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/18A0sm-69TTEl-19DAprqiLHmO-0nBkg4/view?usp=sharing). You should also create an empty folder called Results in the downloaded/cloned LOBSTER repository, download all results from LOBSTER sample workflows [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1GiJd-JfBvOHJcm_WOB1_gAvMuRAZzOy3/view?usp=sharing) and unzip content to Results folder.

LOBSTER License applies to all code except codes stored in the folder _Utils_, which follow the specific licenses of corresponding projects listed [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rZTL-yUn7XA_rwolSOSaje4iVf8pUTrYyZJJM8UQPX0/edit?usp=sharing).
