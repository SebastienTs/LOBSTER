function [pivData,ccFunction] = pivAnalyzeImagePair(im1,im2,pivData,pivParIn)
% pivAnalyzeImagePair - performs single- or multi-pass analysis of displacement between two images using PIV technique
%
% Usage:
% [pivData] = pivAnalyzeImagePair(im1,im2,pivData,pivDataIn);
% [pivData,ccFunction] = = pivAnalyzeImagePair(im1,im2,pivData,pivDataIn);
%
% Inputs:
%    im1,im2 ... image pair (either images, or strings containing paths to image files)
%    pivDataIn ... (struct) structure containing detailed results. No fields are required as the input, but
%          the existing fields will be copies to pivData at the output. If exist, folowing fields will be used:
%        X, Y ... position, at which U, V velocity/displacement is provided
%        U, V ... displacements in x and y direction (will be used for image deformation). If these fields do
%            not exist, zero velocity is assumed
%    pivPar ... (struct) parameters defining the evaluation. Use pivParams.m for creating pivPar. Following
%            fields are considered:
%      --- prefix an - these fields are used mostly in subroutines pivAnalyseImagePair.m
%          anNpasses ... number of passes
%      --- prefix ia - these fields are used mostly in subroutine pivInterrogate.m
%          iaSizeX, iaSizeY ... size of interrogation area [px]
%          iaStepX, iaStepY ... step between interrogation areas [px]
%          imMask1, imMask2 ... Masking images for im1 and im2. It should be either empty (no mask), or of the
%               same size as im1 and im2. Masked pixels should be 0 in .imMaskX, non-masked pixels should be 1
%          iaMethod ... way, how interrogation area are created. Possible values are
%               'basic' ... interrogatio areas are regularly distribute rectangles
%               'offset' ... (not coded) interrogation areas are shifted by the estimated displacement
%               'deflinear' ... (not coded) deformable interrogation areas with linear deformation
%               'defspline' ... (not coded) deformable interrogation areas with spline deformation
%             - Note: if Uest and Vest contains only zeros or if they are empty/unspecified, 'basic' method is
%                    always invoked regardless .iaMethod setting
%          iaImageToDeform ... defines, which image should deform. It is taken in account if .iaMethod is
%                  'deflinear' or 'defspline', or if it is 'offset' (then it defines, in which image IAs are
%                  shifted). Possible values are
%              'image1', 'image2' ... either im1 or im2 is deformed correspondingly to Uest and Vest
%              'both' ... deformation both images are deformed by Uest/2 and Vest/2. Sligthly more CPU time is
%                         required.
%          iaImageInterpolationMethod ... way, how the images are interpolated when deformable IAs are used
%                  (for .iaMethod == 'deflinear' or 'defspline'. Possible values are:
%              'linear', 'spline' ... interpolation is carried out using interp2 function with option either
%                                     '*linear' or '*spline'
%      --- prefix cc - these fields are used mostly in subroutines pivCrossCorr.m
%          ccRemoveIAMean ... if =0, do not remove IA's mean before cross-correlation; if =1, remove the mean;
%              if in between, remove the mean partially
%          ccMaxDisplacement ... maximum allowed displacement to accept cross-correlation peak. This parameter
%              is a multiplier; e.g. setting ccMaxDisplacement = 0.6 means that the cross-correlation peak
%              must be located within [-0.6*iaSizeX...0.6*iaSizeX, -0.6*iaSizeY...0.6*iaSizeY] from the zero
%              displacement.
%            - Note: IA offset is not included in the displacement accounted by ccMaxDisplacement, hence real
%              displacement can be larger if ccIAmethod is any other than 'basic'.
%          ccWindow ... windowing function p. 389 in ref [1]). Possible values are 'uniform', 'gauss',
%             'parzen', 'hanning', 'welch'
%            - default value: 'Welch'. If missing in pivPar during evaluation, 'unifor' is considered for
%              compatibility reasons.
%          ccCorrectWindowBias ... Set whether cc is corrected for bias due to IA windowing.
%            - default value: true (will correct peak)
%      --- prefix vl - these fields relates to vector validation, subroutine pivValidate.m
%          vlTresh, vlEps ... Define treshold for the median test. To accepted, the difference of actual vector
%              from the median (of vectors in the neighborhood) should be at most vlTresh *(vlEps +
%              (neighborhood vectors) - (their median))
%          vlDist ... to what distance median test is performed (if vlDist = 1, kernel has size 3x3; for
%              vlDist = 2, kernel is 5x5, and so on)
%          vlPasses ... number of passes of the median test

%              'linear' ... replace spurious vectors with the use of TriScatteredInterp in Matlab, specifying
%                   its method as 'linear'. If pivData contains data for image sequence, replacement is done

%              'inpaint' ... use D'Errico's subroutine "inpaint_nans". If pivData contains data for image 
%                   sequence, replacement is done in each time slice indepedently on other time slices.
%              'inpaintGarcia' ... use Garcia's subroutine "inpaintn". If pivData contains data for image 
%                   sequence, replacement is done in each time slice indepedently on other time slices.
%              'linearT' ... replace spurious vectors with the use of TriScatteredInterp in Matlab, specifying
%                   its method as 'linear'. If pivData contains data for image sequence, replacement considers
%                   also values in other time slices.
%              'naturalT' ... replace spurious vectors with the use of TriScatteredInterp in Matlab,

%              'inpaintT' ... use D'Errico's subroutine "inpaint_nans". If pivData contains data for image

%              results after each processing pass by pivAnalyseImagePair.m
